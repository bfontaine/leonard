`leonard` is an image processing library written in Go.

The point of this library is for me to learn image processing algorithms by
reimplementing them from scratch. When I started this project I barely knew how
grayscaling an image works and didnâ€™t know what a [matrix convolution][mc] is.

Use [`github.com/disintegration/imaging`][imaging] if you need a Go imaging
library with more features.
